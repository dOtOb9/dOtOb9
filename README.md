## Hi there 👋

I'm `dOtOb9`. Please feel free to call me `he/him`.

I'm passionate about 🩸blood donation!

I play the cello 🎻 and piano 🎹, mainly focusing on classical music. However, I enjoy not only classical but also J-POP!

I'm into mathematics and algorithms, and competitive programming is one of my favorite activities.

I’m interested in VR, AI, and digital construction technologies.
